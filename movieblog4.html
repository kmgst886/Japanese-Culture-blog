                <h2>Description of Chosen Media</h2>
                <p>For the purpose of this blog, I chose to discuss the movie “Lost in Translation (2003)”, a film directed by Sofia Coppola. For those who many not be familiar with the film, it features Bob Harris (Bill Murphy) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who each are portrayed as American Strangers. They meet in Tokyo and form an unlikely friendship as they navigate lonely feelings in foreign culture. Each of the characters lives are currently falling apart from an emotional stand point. Bill Murphy was a former movie star who is no longer in the spotlight, while Scarlett Johansson is just getting out of grad-school and has been abandoned by her boyfriend who is doing business. She is then left to explore Tokyo all on her own. Each of the characters can relate to one other through having sad and disconnected phone calls with their significant other. The two characters end up meeting each other out of boredom and they each were left with nobody else to relate to or talk with.</p>
                <p>This movie captures many key aspects or examples of Japanese culture such as the language barrier, cultural norms, and the contrast between not only modern but also traditional Japanese practices. The movie does a good job on demonstrating how characters feel a very strong disconnection while they are in this environment that is rather unfamiliar to them. As viewer of the movie, we witness an intimate view of the complexities involved in cross-cultural communication. According to an article from Discover Nikkei, “Visually, the movie does a great job of showing a lyrical Tokyo with colors and long shots and you can see the urban landscape in a way that it is downright poetic” (Askawa 2023). The film also shows some of thing things that we anticipate that Japanese culture is about. However, according to article “Lost in Translation”, “Coppola wavers between insight into the comedy of cultural difference and clichéd cultural stereotyping” (King 2017). The film is more focused on enforcing how the characters feel and interact in the environment rather than representing Tokyo itself. The film’s exploration of isolation, culture shock, and the adaptation of foreign setting provides not only an accessible but also an insightful look into Japanese culture. This movie is a significant resource when understanding how those live and communicate in Japanese culture. </p>

                <h2>Relevance to Intercultural Communications</h2>
                <p>This movie can be significantly related to the topics that we discussed in class through the textbook Communication Between Cultures by Samovar, Porter, McDaniel, and Roy (2017). One significant example of this representation is how the film illustrates the idea of cultural adaptation and the concept of high and low content cultures. In the movie, the actors communicate through implicit messages and non-verbal cues. This means that in this case we would say that Japan is a high content culture. An example of this that can be found in the movie would be when the two characters (Bob and Charlotte) struggle to interpret social cues and the unspoken environment around them. This difficulty in understand often needs to mixed feelings of both confusion and frustration among the characters, especially when trying to interact with any of the locals. The characters’ experiences align with the textbook’s discussion of culture shock, as both characters face both significant amounts of both stress and disorientation while facing Japan’s social dynamics that were rather unfamiliar to them. The characters also experience a significant amount of isolation. We as viewers can see this being portrayed in the movie when the show on of the most “poignant scenes depicting Charlotte’s isolation is when she is alone in her hotel room, looking out at the sprawling city of Tokyo,”according to an article from The Global Educator (Biswas 2024). They often incorporate large windows and modify the camera angles to make Charlotte appear small and isolated amongst the city around her. Another example of how this movie related to the textbook is how the movie portrayed how the characters suffered from interpersonal communication challenges due to coming from different cultural backgrounds. This idea also highlights the importance of cultural sensitivity and empathy of other when we are trying to bring several communication gaps together among several different cultures. These examples are not only explain the comparison that can be seen between the movie and the textbook but also the examples can be seen in the real would today. These examples not only help us to understand better but it also helps us to deepen our understanding on intercultural communications. </p>

                <h2>Analysis and Personal Take</h2>
                <p>After watching the movie, I do believe not only does the movie align with a lot of topics that we went over in the textbook but I feel that it has also helped me to better understand Japanese culture. I can’t say that I really understood the culture prior to watching the movie. I always knew that it was different but I never really expected how lost and confused someone would be in that culture. I have never really traveled all that much, or I should say out of the country. So, for the most part I don’t really know what to expect from other cultures other then things I have heard or saw in movies. However, I usually don’t tend to believe what I see in movies, because the film production team usually makes it more about what they want you to see rather than what it actually. However, for this movie it seems to make a good overall comparison to the actual culture. </p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>The movie “Lost in Translation (2003),” is a movie that not only shows the struggles that an outsider faces in another environment or culture but it also demonstrates examples we see in the textbook. The movie is told through a story of two American strangers who are stressed while trying to communicate and interact with the Japanese culture. Through this we see a strong sense of isolation, culture shock, and the struggle to adapt to another world/ culture among the characters. The movie not only deepens our understanding of Japanese culture but it also can deepen our understanding of intercultural communications as a whole. The movie can be connected to topics that we discussed in the textbook “Communication Between Cultures” by Samovar (2017), through how the film illustrates the idea of adapting to different cultures  and the concept of high and low content cultures. We can vision this in the movie when the actors start to experience a struggle when trying to understand social cues and the unspoken communication in the culture that is surrounding them. This example then aligns with the textbook because the actors often experience a feeling of confusion and frustration because they feel that they are getting nowhere with the other party.  Overall, this movie highlights how we need to have empathy when exploring other cultures and trying to bring them together. </p>
