                <h2>Description of Chosen Media</h2>
                <p>Tampopo, is about a woman named Tampopo who wants to make the perfect bowl of ramen. She runs a small noodle shop, and with the help of a kind truck driver named Goro and a few food obsessed strangers, she sets out to learn how to make ramen that really means something. While the story is full of silly moments and funny characters, it also gives us a closer look at Japanese culture, especially how important food is in people’s lives.</p>

        <!-- Container 2 - Green Background -->

            <div class="container-box">
                <h2>Relevance to Intercultural Communication</h2>
                <p>Food also plays a huge role in shaping identity. According to Counihan and Van Esterik, what we eat, and how we eat it, can say a lot about who we are (Counihan et al., 2019). Even though ramen originally came from China, it’s become a big part of Japanese culture. Tampopo shows how ramen has transformed into something deeply Japanese, and that change is part of cultural adaptation. This is when traditions mix and evolve over time as people from different backgrounds share ideas and customs. Tan talks about cultural adaption in his writing about Chinese communities in Malaysia. He explains how people use food to hold onto their roots, even while living in new places and blending with new cultures (The Globalization of Chinese Food 2012). In the same way, Tampopo shows how ramen carries both history and the future. It proves that food can help people keep their identity while still changing with the world around them.</p>
                <p>Another thing the movie shows is how important teamwork and helping others are in Japanese society. Hofstede says Japan is a collectivist culture, which means people care a lot about the group as a whole, not just themselves (Hofstede, 2011). In the movie, tons of different people help Tampopo, even strangers, and they don’t expect anything in return. They just want to see her succeed. That sense of community and shared effort is a big part of the collectivist culture.</p>

        <section id="container3" class="yellow-background">
            <div class="container-box">
                <h2>Analysis and Personal Take</h2>
                <p>One thing I learned from Tampopo is that food isn’t just about filling your stomach. It’s a way people express their feelings, show respect, and build relationships. In Japanese culture, how people eat and the rules around food matter a lot. These little things, like how a dish is served or how someone slurps their noodles, can say more than words. That connects to something we learned in class about high-context cultures. In these cultures, people don’t always say things directly, instead, they rely on actions, body language, and shared traditions to communicate (Samovar et al., 2025). You see high context repeated in the film a lot, characters don’t always talk about how important food is, but you can tell just by the way they prepare it and eat it together. She learns from all kinds of people, and each one teaches her something different about food and life. It shows ethnographic communication, which is when we learn about a culture through its everyday habits and traditions (Samovar et al., 2025).</p>
                <p>Tampopo also shows cultural transmission. Cultural transmission is how people pass down their values and traditions to the next generation (Samovar et al., 2025). In the film, you see this when characters teach each other how to cook and how to act respectfully at the table. It reminds us that food isn’t just something we eat, it’s something we learn. It’s part of how we stay connected to our families, our past, and our culture. A famous scholar named Roland Barthes once said that food is full of hidden meanings (Barthes, 2018). In Tampopo, you see that idea in action. The way ramen is made and served in the movie shows how much the characters care about doing things right. Everything from the broth to the toppings is prepared with care and precision, showing values like hard work, attention to detail, and pride in craftsmanship.</p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>In the end, Tampopo is way more than just a fun movie about noodles. It’s a film that shows how powerful food can be, not just to feed people, but to connect them. It gives us a peek into Japanese values like respect, teamwork, and tradition, all through the lens of something as simple as a bowl of ramen. By looking at concepts like high context communication, collectivism, ethnography, and cultural transmission, we get a better understanding of how food matters in Japanese culture. The movie reminds us that food has a way of telling stories, sharing culture, and bringing people closer together.</p>
