                <h2>Description of Chosen Media</h2>
                <p>This movie starts with Sean Boswell having to move to Japan, because he had gotten into a serious accident racing with another boy he went to high school with. Sean went to Tokyo to live with his dad so he could avoid jail time due to his racing back in the United States. When he moves there he quickly finds racing again, which makes it easier for him to adapt to the culture, finding something he already loved. The movie follows Sean, as he not only forms relationships with others but he evolves in his character as well adapting to the culture and accountability. He quickly forms a friendship with Han who helps him learn the art of drifting and start to form connections to the culture. His rivalry with DK, who is known as the drift king, circles through the entirety of the movie and end with a final race that learns to prove the settling of scores and whoever wins will leave town.  Sean wins the race, and with that earns respect of the racing community. The film ends with you seeing Sean fully immersed with Tokyo drift racing, seeing him fully immersed now with the culture.</p>

                <h2>Relevance to Intercultural Communication</h2>
                <p>Sean going to Japan relates a lot to intercultural communication because of the true culture shock that he experiences when he arrives there, really showing the way that different cultures interact and how difficult that can be.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>This holds great relevance to the U-Curve theory, which is a theory related to the culture shock process. The U-Curve theory suggests that the adaptation process is natural and individual and no matter the amount of preparation, or self confidence it will take time differently for everyone. So the way that Sean confidently went to Japan, thinking that he would not be there for long, made the adjustment more difficult. Even his first day in the school it was an adjustment to the way that classrooms were oriented, and the shoes that he would wear. The U-Curve also suggests that each person’s experience is defined by what they bring to it, so how immediately after school he found other people racing, made it easier for him to adjust to the Japanese culture because he found the interest that he had with other people.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Another theory that holds relevance to Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift, is the theory of intercultural competence. This is defined as “…The ability to understand and respect each other across all types of cultural barriers”(Dalessandra, 2021). From the beginning him and Neela have an understanding and respect amongst each other and she is one of the people that really helps him learn to adapt to the culture. When Sean first moves to Japan as well, he really starts off as a loud American, unwilling to really accept the reality of his situation. He evolves to have respect, adapting to learn the Japanese culture and truly being one with the culture.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Going back to the initial example of his culture shock going into Japan, that relates to the textbook through the definition of intercultural adaptation process. The way that it is defined through this process is going through the uncertainty and anxiety of living in a new environment, while also establishing how to communicate with a new culture. The way that Sean learns to do this, is mainly through his relationships with Han and Neela, in where they help him to define the difference between American and Japanese non-verbal forms of communication. Forming these relationships was the way that helped him to adapt to the culture.</p>

                <h2>Analysis and Personal Take</h2>
                <p>Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift is a perfect example of how cultures learn to interact when they are put in another cultural environment, or country. Which is the definition of Intercultural Communication and showcasing how when you find commonality amongst cultures, it makes it that much easier to adapt. For example, how very early on to Sean moving to Japan he finds racing there which was his passion back home as well. This movie has a lot of great examples to how relationship building can help people to learn other cultural aspects at a much quicker rate, which is a great point highlighted by the text as well. You see where there is the significant change in Sean’s adjustment to Japan, once he starts forming those relationships and allows himself to find part of himself in the culture through racing. You see how Neela and Sean can form relationships through commonality through life experience, despite growing up with different cultures. There was that true thaw in that moment where you see that cultures truly learn to see one another once that barrier is broken down and you can see despite the difference in cultures, there is always commonality that can be found.</p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Cultures are not all that different once you embrace the change and see the way that people can evolve when they are put together. Being able to watch Sean’s transformation before and after moving to Japan, you see how not only the relationships change him, but the culture as well it made him evolve to be better than he was. There are many ways that you see people evolve in cultures and how there is a lot of relevance to intercultural concepts in this movie because of how hard it can be to adapt to a culture so different from your own. The main point is that cultural change is adapted differently by everyone, and sometimes there are factors that influence it, like Sean’s love for racing that he found in Japan, and how over time it can influence the way that people can see other cultures once they are fully immersed. </p>
